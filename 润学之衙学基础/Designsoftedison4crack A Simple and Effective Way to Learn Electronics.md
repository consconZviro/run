DesignSoft Edison 5 is a powerful software that allows you to create, simulate and test electrical circuits in a realistic 3D environment. You can use it to learn the basics of electricity and electronics, as well as to design your own projects and experiments. In this article, we will show you how to use DesignSoft Edison 5 for circuit simulation and design.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install DesignSoft Edison 5
 
The first step is to download and install DesignSoft Edison 5 on your computer. You can get it from the official website of DesignSoft, or from other sources online. However, be careful not to download a cracked version of the software, as it may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or compromise your data. A cracked version may also have limited functionality or compatibility issues with your system.

The best way to get DesignSoft Edison 5 is to purchase a license from the official website. The price is $150 for a single user license, which includes free updates and technical support. You can also get a free trial version for 30 days, which has all the features of the full version but with some limitations on the number of components and circuits you can use.
 
## Step 2: Launch DesignSoft Edison 5 and Choose a Mode
 
Once you have installed DesignSoft Edison 5, you can launch it from your desktop or start menu. You will see two main windows: one for the schematic view and one for the 3D view. You can work in either one, as they are synchronized in real time.

You can also choose between different modes of operation: Lessons, Experiments, Problems or Projects. Lessons are interactive tutorials that teach you the principles of electricity and electronics. Experiments are pre-designed circuits that you can modify and test. Problems are quizzes that challenge you to solve equations or find errors in circuits. Projects are where you can create your own circuits from scratch or from templates.
 
## Step 3: Add Components and Wires to Your Circuit
 
To add components and wires to your circuit, you can use the toolbar on the left side of the schematic window. You can find various types of components, such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, switches, LEDs, motors, speakers and more. You can also use the search box to find a specific component by name or symbol.
 
To place a component on the grid, simply drag and drop it from the toolbar. To connect components with wires, click on one terminal of a component and drag to another terminal of another component. You can also use junctions and labels to make your circuit more organized and clear.
 
## Step 4: Adjust Component Values and Properties
 
To adjust component values and properties, you can double-click on a component or right-click on it and select Properties. A dialog box will appear where you can change the parameters of the component, such as resistance, voltage, current, frequency, color, shape and more.
 
You can also use sliders, knobs or meters to adjust component values interactively in the 3D view. To do this, click on the component in the 3D view and drag the mouse up or down to change its value. You can also click on a meter to see its reading in detail.
 
## Step 5: Run Simulation and Analyze Results
 
To run simulation and analyze results, you can use the toolbar on the right side of the schematic window. You can find various tools for simulation control, measurement, analysis and visualization.
 
To start simulation, click on the Play button or press F5. To pause simulation, click on the Pause button or press F6. To stop simulation, click on the Stop button or press F7.
 
To measure voltage, current or power in your circuit, you can use probes or multimeters. To place a probe or a multimeter on your circuit, drag and drop it from the toolbar. To see its reading in detail, double-click on it or right-click on it and select Show Reading.
 
To analyze your circuit in different ways, you can use oscilloscopes, function generators, spectrum analyzers or logic analyzers. To place an instrument on your circuit, drag
